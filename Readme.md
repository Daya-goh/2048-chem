### Description
This is a well-loved 2048 game with a chemistry twist to it. The game was designed and implemented using HTML, CSS, and Javascript while attending the Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly.

After sinking many hours into the game 2048 when I was younger, I wanted to build a 2048 game with a science twist to it. I want to include my love for science to the game I love (even up to now). 2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game designed by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli. The gameâ€™s objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. 

In this game, instead of combining numbers, you will combine elements to get the next element from the periodic table. Through this game, you will get familiar with the first 40 elements of the periodic table. 

### Deployment
The game is deployed on GitHub pages, and you can play the game here:

### How To Play
Use your arrow keys to move the tiles. Tiles with the same element merge into one when they touch. Add them up to reach the highest element Zirconium[40]!

### WireFrame

Before  coding the game, I planned out the design and the possible logic or the game. This helps me to break down the project into managebable parts and also plan out the possible codes/functions needed. 

Before creating the code for the game, I drew out the different components of the game and everything I knew and could observe about the game mechanics. This allowed me to identify the various visual components of the game which will affect my HTML and CSS codes, and which parts I would need to make interactive, which affects the JS portion of my codes.
